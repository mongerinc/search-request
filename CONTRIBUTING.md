## Bugs, Questions, and Feature Requests

If you've found a bug with SearchRequest, if you have a question, or if you have a feature request, the best way to get our attention is to post an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mongerinc/search-request/issues). A significant portion of SearchRequest's features have been developed because someone asked if it could be included. So don't be afraid to ask away!

## Pull Requests

The fastest way to get what you want is to submit a well-organized pull request. They don't always get merged into the core, but they almost always make us think about what is possible with SearchRequest and whether or not our current approach is adequate. If you'd like to submit a pull request, there are a few things that you should do in order to ensure a timely response:

- Fork from the `dev` branch. Also submit your PR to the `dev` branch. PRs that are submitted to the `master` branch will be closed immediately.

- Merge the latest changes from the `dev` branch before you submit the pull request. If you have a request that can't be automatically merged, you may be asked to marge the latest changes and resubmit it.

- Add documentation for your changes to the relevant section in the `/docs` directory.

- Add any necessary unit tests.

- Make sure your submitted code matches the style of the library.

## Collaborators

All collaborators should commit minor changes that don't need to be reviewed directly to the `dev` branch. Any semi-large project should be submitted as a PR to the `dev` branch.

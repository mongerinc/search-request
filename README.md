==SearchRequest==

This library provides a set of classes that help represent requests for complex data and provides a way to convert requests to and from a standard JSON format. If you have interfaces with tons of parameters ($filters, $groupings, $page, $rowsPerPage, etc.), or if you're just looking for a standard way to communicate complex requests to other apps without racking your brain over how to represent this data in JSON, you will like this library.

==Installation==

Install SearchRequest via composer by adding the following to the `require` block in your `composer.json` file:

```
"mongerinc/search-request": "1.*"
```
